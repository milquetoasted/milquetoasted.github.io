    <p>[<i>intro voiceovers of lines repeated from later in the video</i>]</p>

    <p>
    <b>Hongbo Zhao</b>: Training, this year we trained the most. No breaks. We want a turnaround. 
    Want Chinese pair skating to stand up once more. You can't possibly place in the tens. 
    You have to go and fight for the top few places in the world.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Narrator</b>: The Chinese Skating Association has split two pair skating teams and re-partnered them.
    Veteran of 3 Olympics, Hao Zhang, was paired with Xiaoyu Yu, and his partner of 4 years, Cheng Peng, was paired with Xiaoyu Yu's partner Yang Jin.
    This news immediately caused a frenzy among skating fans, with sounds of questioning and confusion.
    </p>

    <p><b>Zhao</b>: I don't look. A lot of things, I don't need to look at them.</p>

    <p><b>Cheng Peng</b>: Whenever we speak of April each year, think of April, it's truly something... quite uncomfortable. Last April.</p>

    <p><b>Hao Zhang</b>: Of course there are a lot of online comments, and we actually do see them too.
    At that time, the mood, it was not great either. We, as athletes, have to continue focusing on bringing results, training hard.</p>

    <p><b>Narrator</b>: Wenjing Sui recently returned from getting the season's new programs choreographed in Canada.
    Yesterday afternoon she accepted surgery for her ankles.</p>

    <p><b>Announcer</b>: Now, the last pair of competitors will take the ice, from China, Wenjing Sui and Cong Han.
    After going through a long period of injury and rehabilitation, this 4CC is their comeback battle.</p>

    <p>[<i>title: Chinese pair skating</br> Unlocking the dilemma</i>]</p>

    <p>
    <b>Ying Chen (Interviewer)</b>: Audience and friends, hello. Welcome to 风云会.
    For this program, we've specially invited China's pair skating head coach, Hongbo Zhao. Hello, coach Hongbo.
    </p>

    <p><b>Zhao</b>: Hello, Ying Chen.</p>

    <p>
    <b>Chen</b>: This season at the competitions we've seen you, every time while your skaters are performing, 
    you're standing at the boards, your never crack a smile, just with a serious face.
    </p>

    <p><b>Zhao</b>: (laughs)</p>

    <p>
    <b>Chen</b>: Looking at your face, really, your expression is very serious.
    And it also seems that in training, you're quite ruthless. Do you use a lot of pressure?
    </b>

    <p><b>Zhao</b>: It's not quite, my training is not extremely ruthless.
    </p>

    <p>
    [<i>subtitles</i>] <b>Zhao</b>: Right now is the pressure too much? We are fighting to be champions.
    Who is asking you to take it, who said you had to take it? You are giving yourselves pressure. [<i>end subtitles</i>]
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Zhao</b>: This season, Chinese pair skating is facing its most difficult year.
    There's surgery, and then there's the pair swap. Including the junior teams, our two teams, they're new as well.
    It's only been a year. Everyone is fighting. Every single element, you're fighting for the top spots in the world.
    Competing with twists, throws, from landings to entrances to air position, you want all the elements to be top level.
    Your 14 elements, if they are all among the best in the world, including single elements, then you are World champions.
    The requirements are, if any part of your stance worsens, these are the rules, then you're simply not as good as the others.
    Then you… if you want to change, want to win, then you have to change your views and start over. So a lot of finesse is required.
    </p>

    <p><b>Chen</b>: At the World Championships, your goals, specifically what place?</p>

    <p>
    <b>Zhao</b>: 2017 Worlds, it's the qualifying event for the Pyeongchang Olympics. 
    We can say it's the 'heaviest among heavy' World Championships. 
    Right now, in pair skating, the structure, there are two Russian teams. And a Canadian one, Duhamel and co. 
    And the Germans. Among these three, there are actually no competitors with absolute advantages. 
    Everyone is looking at the performances on the spot, on the same ice. Therefore, I'm saying for this year, 
    I told the athletes early this season, this is the messiest season. The differences between everyone's ability 
    levels are not much. And for Wenjing Sui and Cong Han, with the rehabilitation this year, the hope that everyone 
    has for their new programs, all the attention, as well as the abilities that they've displayed, there will be ups 
    and downs. For Hao Zhang and co, after the re-partnering, the judges have given recognition to the quality of 
    their elements. They're both qualified for the difficult of the quad twist. As a whole, if they complete both of 
    their programs very well, then maybe - of course this isn't something where I say they must get a certain result. 
    The most important thing is still seeing how they perform on competition ice.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Chen</b>: Wenjing Sui and Cong Han, Xiaoyu Yu and Hao Zhang, these two pairs, we know that right from the 
    debut they use highly difficult elements, giving everyone an impression. We have the quad throw, the quad twist, 
    these have already been completed in training.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Zhao</b>: Right now, the quad twist, for Chinese athletes, like Wenjing Sui and Cong Han or Xiaoyu Yu and 
    Hao Zhang, they have [the 4Tw]. They're focused now on improving the quality. Completing it is not an issue, 
    and in regular training, it can be done many times each day. And compared to the throw, it's safe, because of the 
    protection and the catch, it's relatively safer. So we won't say, this season, right at Worlds, to do the quad 
    throw. And then this year's battles, soon they're going to be the preparation for next year's battles. Perhaps 
    in training we will try it.
    </p>

    <p>[<i>t/n: narrator and announcer are voiceovers over video segments in between parts of the interview</i>]</p>

    <p>
    <b>Narrator</b>: The quad twist and quad throw can be called strategies of Chinese pair skating. In February 2016, 
    Wenjing Sui and Cong Han successfully completed both quads in a program for the first time. Afterwards, in April, 
    they brought out these elements again at the World Championships. Unfortunately, Wenjing Sui's landing on the quad 
    throw was unsuccessful. In the end, this young pair received the second World silver medal of their career. Those 
    who are familiar with Wenjing Sui all know that behind these two silver medals are years of enduring foot injuries. 
    After returning from Boston, head coach Hongbo Zhao made a decision.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Zhao</b>: Last April, Wenjing Sui underwent surgery on both ankles. The outer ligaments were all broken, 
    and after they broke, they were also persisting injuries. Although they were broken she's still been competing for 
    these past two years. However, for the purpose of the Pyeongchang Olympics, and also the 2022 Olympics, 
    she underwent the surgery.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Narrator</b>: Wenjing Sui recently returned from getting the season's new programs choreographed in Canada. 
    Yesterday afternoon she accepted surgery for her ankles. 
    [<i>t/n: the narrator gives a more detailed description of the injury, but I can't recognize the anatomy.</i>] 
    From what we understand, the surgery was successful, and rehabilitation will require around 4 months.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Wenjing Sui</b>: I was pushed into the operation room, and the moment I received the anesthetic, 
    I felt like my mind was wiped totally blank. Whether or not I could return to figure skating - it was terrifying, 
    I thought about that a lot. This surgery, since it was both ankles, how I would wear my skates in the future was 
    all unknown variables. Not like an arm, or a knee, things that practically have no contact with your skates. 
    Both feet is really a huge risk.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Chen</b>: At the time of Wenjing Sui's surgery, it was probably, to her, a very important point in her life. 
    Then, I think, to a girl, you need to persuade her to accept such an event. At that time, from what I understand, 
    you used your experience from before the Turin Olympics [t/n: Zhao ruptured his Achilles tendon in 2005 and was 
    unable to return to the ice until shortly before the 2006 Olympics], that big surgery, you used that experience to 
    communicate with her. Is that so?
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Zhao</b>: At the time, I firstly encouraged her more about the state of mind. You have to accept the reality, 
    after this reality you still can't give up on yourself. How is it, you cannot give up. You just got a World silver medal, 
    so then want an Olympic gold medal even more. So, for people like us, it feels like the sky is falling. 
    You had an accident. Everyone is preparing for the Olympics, that kind of excitement, and then suddenly all turns into nothing. 
    It feels like a disaster. I said, for people like you and me, the damage is too much. We have accidents. 
    Right as you're preparing to compete, if your foot suddenly breaks, then how will you go onto the ice? 
    And then you have rehabilitation, you just have half a year, just 6 months. I said, what we're doing, 
    what you're doing right now, there are steps. There is a schedule. We can weigh the options. Going for this, 
    it is an action that's been prepared for. Cong Han is also a very good partner. Encouraging, supporting.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Cong Han</b>: This was a very long period of time, but also very enriching. Every week, I couldn't visit every day, 
    but every week as much as possible I would go to the hospital to visit her, and give her a little encouragement. 
    I know that I might not be very useful, and her recovery would depend on herself, but I know, in her heart I would be there, 
    I would be a part of it, right? And so I would also feel a bit fulfilled myself. (<i>laughs</i>)
    </p>

    <p><b>Sui</b>: Good, good. (<i>claps, laughs</i>)</p>

    <p>
    <b>Han</b>: It hasn't been easy. It hasn't been easy. And then, when the time came to return to training, I needed to support her.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Announcer</b>: Now, the last pair of competitors will take the ice, from China, Wenjing Sui and Cong Han. 
    After going through a long period of injury and rehabilitation, this 4CC is their comeback battle.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Sui</b>: I think the entire program, because it tells, it narrates our story, every step is our experience, every 
    step is our mileage. Every motion is a word we want to say. So, I think the entire program is creating the spirit that we 
    had then. Once you've accumulated to a certain extent, you'll naturally let out what you want to say, with prepared language.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Chen</b>: Actually, figure skating competitions are not purely competitions of athleticism. 
    Artistic impact and performance are essential. Wenjing Sui and Cong Han, this year, despite only having competed at 4CC, 
    we feel that this pair has already skated out a sort of 'soul' of figure skating, that's how the audience has evaluated it. 
    What do you think of their improvements on the performance side this year?
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Zhao</b>: I think the two silver medals at the World Championships have made this pair of competitors more confident, 
    more daring. They have a background under them, anchoring them. For many Chinese athletes it feels like we're not very open, 
    unlike foreign athletes who, as soon as they step on the ice, there's lots of openness. In figure skating you need that. 
    This year, Wenjing Sui and Cong Han, since they've had the experience of being World silver medalists, achieving that twice, 
    they are very willing to take, they can sink into their performance. This year's programs, when we had Lori choreographing them, 
    we were thinking and being very meticulous. Lori has worked with the Chinese team for many years, an old friend, 
    and she's very familiar with these athletes. So when choosing this year's music, we picked a slower, romantic piece. 
    In terms of technique and performance, from the past few years, there's been lots of improvement, such as comprehension of the music, 
    finesse of movements, including the details of specific phrasing. We've analyzed all of that, taking it apart and working on it. 
    To realize a program, personal interpretation is one aspect, and another aspect is for us to take everything and dissect it. 
    What does this part express? What's your main storyline? You have to show it clearly to us, first make it obvious to the coaches, 
    and then we can make fine adjustments in certain areas. So overall, they can absolutely do difficult elements on the ice, 
    and also get deeper to let the artistry emerge.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Chen</b>: Their feel, this year, looking at their performances, they can really draw the audience in. 
    It's like they're performing a show on the ice. You previously said this line, you said that this season, 
    it's the most difficult season for pair skating. You talked about the injuries for Wenjing Sui and Cong Han. 
    The other subject here is the disassembly and re-pairing of two pairs. I've often, every time I see you on television, 
    the most memorable thing is how this year, you really give the impression that you're much more worn out.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Zhao</b>: There's some pressure. Actually, I gave this pressure to myself. Even two years ago, actually, 
    I was thinking about making some adjustments, but that wasn't implemented the entire time. Then this year, 
    since last year's results at Worlds were not ideal, we want a turnaround. Want Chinese pair skating to stand up once more. 
    You can't possibly place in the tens. You have to go and fight for the top few places in the world. 
    When considering the big picture, then we should make the swap.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Announcer</b>: At the World Championships in April 2016, apart from Wenjing Sui and Cong Han who received a silver medal, 
    the other two Chinese pairs both did not have ideal results. Cheng Peng and Hao Zhang placed 12th; Xuehan Wang and Lei Wang were 15th. 
    Chinese pair skating has long since lost the overall team strength of its peak days. Not long after Worlds ended, 
    head coach Hongbo Zhao announced that two partnerships would be split and re-partnered. 
    Veteran Hao Zhang and World Junior champion Xiaoyu Yu became partners. His original partner, Cheng Peng, 
    was paired with Xiaoyu Yu's partner Yang Jin. This news immediately caused a frenzy among skating fans, 
    with the sounds of questioning and confusion causing division.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Chen</b>: In the beginning, when there were the most questions, 
    I know that on the internet it was widespread and there were all sorts of attacks on you. How did you pass this period?
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Zhao</b>: (<i>laughs</i>) I think, for those types of comments, I don't look. A lot of things, I don't need to look at them. 
    Even though there are people talking, I won't. Because this is my job. Of course... Actually, I feel thankful to everyone since 
    everyone is paying more and more attention to figure skating, at a new level. People understand more, and they like it more. 
    You'd only pay so much attention if you really liked it. On the technical side, right now many people can recognize elements, 
    can tell them apart very clearly. And they've given us lots of good suggestions. I think that's a good thing. 
    Thank you everyone for following figure skating like this, for following the athletes like this. Actually, a lot, 
    I wanted more to tell them at the time, encourage the athletes more, since once you're at the venue and the doors close, 
    once the skaters are on the ice, it's only the athletes left. Nobody else can do more at this point. I can't do more either. 
    There are always things like, 'I'm distressed', or sometimes crying, the athletes did go through that for a while during the swap.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Peng</b>: Whenever we speak of April each year, think of April, it's truly something… quite uncomfortable. Last April. 
    Actually, at that time I wasn't mature enough. Now, thinking back, if I could let go of the things in my heart, etc, 
    for brother Jiang [<i>t/n: Yang Jin's Chinese nickname</i>], and for me, it would have been beneficial.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Yang Jin</b>: Switching partners, for both, was definitely a big mental hurdle. For girls, it might be different from guys, 
    if their mentality isn't good, or they don't feel well, they'd show it. For us males, we would hide it more, 
    since the girls definitely had to endure more things.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Xiaoyu Yu</b>: We were told suddenly, and we had little time for a heavy responsibility then. Within a short while, 
    one month, so many things happened. It gave us all a rough time. Since we had to switch partners, and then finish the 
    choreography and learn the technical elements in Canada, and then prepare for the upcoming season, nobody dared to imagine 
    how we would perform, what kind of growth we would experience, whether it would be good or bad. Nobody dared to imagine.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Zhang</b>: Of course there are a lot of online comments, and we actually do see them too. At that time, the mood, 
    it was not great either, but since they've already made the decision, we, as athletes, have to continue focusing on bringing 
    results, training hard.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Zhao</b>: Moreso, if you don't want to be affected [by the comments], they don't read them anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Chen</b>: That time, the gamble resulted in a favourable outcome. You won the gamble. What if you lost, 
    what would you do? Did you consider that at the time?
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Zhao</b>: In my heart, I had confidence. Since I know these athletes, and understand them. 
    Since we are too familiar with this field, with all the athletes, so the way they are now, the way they can be in the future, 
    we have estimates. China needs to build a team, a team of three pairs, and we have the qualifications for it. 
    That year in Vancouver, and in Italy…
    </p>

    <p><b>Chen</b>: Turin.</p>

    <p><b>Zhao</b>: Turin. We had already built up overall strength in Chinese pair skating.</p>

    <p>
    <b>Chen</b>: Troika. [<i>t/n: troika is a traditional Russian sleigh pulled by three horses. 
    the three 'horses' here are the pairs Shen/Zhao, Pang/Tong, and Zhang/Zhang</i>]
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Zhao</b>: Troika. Then, each with their own responsibilities, go all out.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Chen</b>: The troika that we just spoke of, right now, of the original members from those days, only Hao Zhang remains. 
    The athlete Hao Zhang, what do you think about his progress? And where he can improve?
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Zhao</b>: Zhang and co, speaking purely of technical elements, they are fairly strong internationally. 
    Then, in terms of performance, there's still a very big gap. Xiaoyu Yu's lines are very elegant, very long, 
    and when you compare Hao Zhang to that, his [lines] are shallower, slower, movements are heavier. Then now, 
    perhaps for the next step in choreography and training, we need to adjust a lot. Part of it is awareness - 
    do you want to win? If you want to be a World champion, then you must change your own awareness. 
    Just completing my training regimen, that's meaningless. You have to, under these conditions, 
    have a stronger desire for victory, to win over your opponents - domestically, mentally, internationally. 
    So every pair, every person, they each have their own viewpoints. And they bounce those ideas with our coaching team. 
    Including Cheng Peng and Yang Jin - this year they've also risen a lot. And after switching partners, Cheng Peng, 
    this year she's skated cleanly multiple times. And with consistency, scores rise. And the two of them, 
    in their performances and their communication with each other, they've reached silent understanding. 
    Cheng Peng's heart has also strengthened a lot. So it's still the same words, those three pairs - 
    I hope they can all qualify to be among the top in the world. This is the echelon for our Chinese pair skating program, 
    the echelon that we're building, for Pyeongchang and for 2022.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Announcer</b>: Next to skate, from China, Xiaoyu Yu and Hao Zhang.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Narrator</b>: From the pair swap in April 2016 to the 2016 Grand Prix series, after just a few short months of 
    training together, the new pair Xiaoyu Yu and Hao Zhang won the silver medal at Skate Canada and the gold medal at Cup of China, 
    qualifying for the Grand Prix Final, and received a silver medal there. At this year's Asian Winter Games, 
    they stood atop the podium with a score of 223.88. The other pair, Cheng Peng and Yang Jin, also qualified for the GPF 
    with their silver medals at Cup of China and NHK Trophy. At this year's Asian Winter Games, they were right behind 
    Xiaoyu Yu and Hao Zhang and placed second.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Chen</b>: For the spectators of this sport, the results that we wanted to see have already appeared. 
    But I didn't expect that to happen so quickly, and thought that it would maybe take one season of working together, 
    with the results not appearing until the following season. But really, things meshed together quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Zhao</b>: That's why my hair is much whiter now. (laughs) According to our plans, our expectations, we thought that this year, 
    the year of preparation for war, there would be improvement. We didn't expect that over the entire series of competitions this season, 
    things would go this well. At several competitions they completed their elements well and received very good feedback from the judges, 
    who gave recognition to these re-partnered pairs. You need 2 years to really prepare. 
    The Germans, they prepared for 3 years after the new partnership, 2 or 3 years until emerging.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Chen</b>: 2 years, yes.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Zhao</b>: About 2 years.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Chen</b>: They hadn't competed for 2 years.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Zhao</b>: During those 2 years without competition, they trained. And then they can emerge when and how they want to. For Chinese pairs, we didn't have that time. You can't tell us to leave you for 2 years, because then, you're competing with the wind. If you want to do that, then you need to have trained adequately. We still haven't practiced enough. I think, if we want to be stronger, if we want 3 shadows of China reaching for the top 3 spots, then it's necessary to practice to become stronger. Their overall condition right now, their pre-competition conditions, right now there's confidence. Preparing to skate, looking at your competitors, you have to negotiate a high price.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Zhang</b>: For us, it's necessary to keep a good state of mind, strengthen one's resolve. Also, resting well, adjusting well. Making ample preparations for the World Championships.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Yu</b>: A big competition should bring nervousness, but this time I feel relaxed. Perhaps it's because my performance in practice is in the right place, so I have more confidence in myself. So now, I think as long as a good performance can be brought out - keeping a calm mentality, and then being able to display our hard work at this closing battle of the World Championships - then I'm satisfied.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Han</b>: Dare to think, dare to do. The gold medal isn't something that, as before, I might not have be bold enough to imagine, but now I can dare to think, dare to do.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Sui</b>: As long as we skate at our usual level, then we only need to defeat ourselves. We're not overthinking it. As long as we can surpass ourselves every time, every day - maybe some things become direct milestones, where we can gain something, but that's incidental. We only need to be our best selves.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Narrator</b>: The 2017 World Figure Skating Championships. China is sending 2 teams for the pairs discipline - 2-time, 2015-16 World silver medalists Wenjing Sui and Cong Han, and 2016-17 GPF silver medalists Xiaoyu Yu and Hao Zhang - and striving for 3 spots for the Pyeongchang Olympics. This is also the discipline where China has the best shot at a gold medal. In ladies' singles, 14th-place finisher in Sochi, Zijun Li, and 11th-place finisher at the 2017 WJC, Xiangning Li, will work hard and fight for Olympic spots. In men's singles, 7th-place finisher in Sochi, Han Yan, will be absent due to shoulder injuries. 2016 World bronze medalist, young quadster Boyang Jin, will be our sole representative charging into a ring of strong competition.
